# calgen
Copyright Â© 2013 Bart Massey

This goofy little program generates a "blank" academic
course calendar in either HTML or Markdown formats. Does all
the date wrapping correctly. Defaults to 10-week terms, but
this is selectable. Say `calgen --help` to understand usage.

To build, you'll need `cabal-install`, my `parseargs`
package from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org), and a
recent `ghc`. Then just say "cabal configure; cabal install"
and you should be golden.

The file `calgen.sh` in this repo is the Bourne-shell
original that I used as a prototype for this Haskell
version. It is neither as complete nor as robust, but it is
more compact.
